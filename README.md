## Introduction
The project at hand involves the creation of a digital presentation for a burger joint's brochure. This initiative was proposed as a practical exercise to apply fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, I learned to use the CorelDRAW tool to create a logo and produce the brochure, both of which are very useful tools in the production of creative designs.
